Lambda Function
Lambda Expression
•	This function 	can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and return.
•	You need to keep in your knowledge that lambada functions are syntactically restricted to single expression.
•	It is more efficient than 	function when the function task is small.
•	Do not use lambada function when task is complex
•	It works best when you have to call a Function millions of times but the execution task is simple.
Filter Function:
•	The filter() function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments. To filter out all the sequences, for which the function returns true.
Map Function:
•	The map() function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments. The function is called with lambda function and a list and a new list is returned which contains all the lambda modified items returned by that function for each item.
Reduce Function:
•	The reduce() function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments. The function is called with lambda function and a list and a new reduced result is returned. This performs the repetitive operation over the pairs of the list.
•	The reduce() function will always take two parameters.
